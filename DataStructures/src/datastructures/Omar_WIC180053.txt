My name is Omar Abdul Aziz Bin Che Othman with matrix number, WIC180053. I am
majoring in Computer System and Network. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling very optimisitc about taking this
subject. This is because it is a huge part in the IT and Technology's field.
I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will work smart and hard to achieve this target. Wish me luck!!!

 in this course. ..........
